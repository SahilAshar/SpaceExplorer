Space Explorer
=============

Welcome to Space Explorer v2.0! 

To play, download the repository, and just run the RunGame.bat file! It's pretty simple, and easy to play!

What's new in v2.0?
=============

-Patched the error where the ship did not dissapear.

-Updated graphics

-There's now a cool Easter Egg in the game, and I'm going to tell you what it is because I'm nice. Press the '`' or '~' key next to the ONE key to activate it!


Controls
=============

The UP and DOWN arrow keys control the ship, and SPACE is shoot! 




I will be updating the game periodically with new features, and other stuff, so check back often!
